**Vortice.Win32** is a **.NET 7.0** and **.NET 8.0** low-level bindings for Win32, generation is based on json files from [win32json](https://github.com/marlersoft/win32json), follows naming conventions of Vortice.Windows but small GC allocation and using unsafe struct for COM objects.

**NOTE** Starting from 15/11/2023 this project is archived, I suggest to use [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET)
